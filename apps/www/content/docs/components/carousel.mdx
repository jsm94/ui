## Introduction

Creating a carousel is a common task in web development. There are many different ways to do it, but most of them are either too complex or too limited.
Thankfully, there's a better way. [Embla Carousel]() is a lightweight and highly extensible carousel library that makes it easy to create beautiful carousels.

So we provide a fully functional `<Carousel />` component with navigation, that works great with Embla Carousel and makes it even easier to extend.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn-ui add carousel
```

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="manual-installation">
    <AccordionTrigger>Manual Installation</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>

<Callout>
**Note:** It's necessary to have installed the components `Button` and `Badge` from this library and install `lucide-chart` for this `Carousel` component example, but you can replace all of them with your own.

</Callout>

1. Install `embla-carousel`:

```bash
npm install embla-carousel
```

2. Copy and paste the following code into your project.

<ComponentSource src="/components/ui/carousel.tsx" />

    </AccordionContent>

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Examples

### Basic Carousel

<ComponentExample src="/components/examples/carousel/demo.tsx">
  <CarouselDemo />
</ComponentExample>

### Carousel with navigation

We can use the benefits of **Embla Carousel api** to build a navigation for our carousel.

<ComponentExample src="/components/examples/carousel-navigation/demo.tsx">
  <CarouselNavigationDemo />
</ComponentExample>

See also [Embla Carousel documentation](https://www.embla-carousel.com/get-started/) for more information and build more powerful carousels.
